# WanGP-Launcher
A Simple WanGP Launcher for Miniconda Users
# How to Use It

Depending on your Miniconda installation and WanGP folder location, you need to edit the paths in the script using a text editor (like Notepad).

### 1. Change Conda activation path  

set "CONDA_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\miniconda3\Scripts\activate.bat"

For Example : set "CONDA_PATH=D:\Programs\miniconda3\Scripts\activate.bat"

### 2.Change WanGP project folder path

set "WANGP_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\wan2gp"

For Example : set "WANGP_PATH=D:\AI\Wan2GP"

Make sure to keep the quotes " " around the path if it contains spaces.
